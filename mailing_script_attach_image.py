       <p>Greetings %s!</p>
        <p>We are proud to announce and invite you to Paper Presentation, APOGEE 2016. </p>
        <p>First, we take this opportunity to express our gratitude for students like you for <br>
        participating in the event and making APOGEE 2015 a resounding success. </p>
        The event, which will be held during APOGEE, from the 25th to 28th February 2016, is <br>
        an excellent opportunity to showcase your research work and compete with the best <br>
        minds of the country. Also, with lots of  prizes to be won and a chance to get your <br>
        paper published in a reputed journal, this definitely, is one of the most exciting <br>
        and interesting events of APOGEE.</p>
        <p>However, this year the paper presentation event will follow a slightly different <br>
        timeline. Weâ€™ll invite abstracts in the beginning of the month of October. The result <br>
        for this round will be announced by mid November. The selected candidates will have <br>
        to send their papers by mid January 2016. After the plagiarism check of the papers,<br>
        shortlisted participants will be invited for the final event of Paper Presentation<br>
        at APOGEE 2016.</p>
        <p>For further notifications keep checking our <a href=http://goo.gl/SCx9ub> website </a> and 
        <a href=https://goo.gl/8XzD6A> Facebook page </a> </p>
